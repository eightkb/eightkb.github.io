Hello everyone, we hope that you're continuing to stay safe out there!

This is a short post to let you know that there will not be a winter edition of EightKB this year.

There's been a tonne of awesome virtual conferences over the last couple of years and it looks like in-person conferences are now starting to kick back off in Spring this year.

With that in mind, we have decided to cancel this year's winter event HOWEVER...

We will be back for EightKB Summer 2022, coming on August 3rd with 5 more amazing in-depth technical sessions!

The call for speakers will open in the spring...check out twitter handle [@EightKBConf](https://twitter.com/EightKbConf) and here for the announcement.

Until then...we hope you all stay well and if you can't wait to hear from us...check out the [Mixed Extents podcast on YouTube](https://eightkb.online/mixedextents/)

Thanks and see you soon!<br>
Andrew, Anthony, and Mark<br>
The EightKB Committe

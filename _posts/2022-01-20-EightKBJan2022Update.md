## EightKB Update!

Hello everyone, we hope that you're continuing to stay safe out there!

This is a short post to let you know that there will not be a winter edition of EightKB this year.

We've all been feeling the strain of the last couple of years and there's been a tonne of (awesome) virtual conferences so we feel that people are starting to get conference fatigue.

With that in mind, we have decided to cancel this year's winter event HOWEVER...

We will be back for EightKB Summer 2022, coming on August 3rd with 5 more amazing in-depth technical sessions!

The call for speakers will open in the spring...check out twitter handle @EightKBConf and here for the announcement.

Until then...we hope you all stay well and if you can't wait to hear from us...check out the Mixed Extents podcast on YouTube: -

Thanks and see you soon!

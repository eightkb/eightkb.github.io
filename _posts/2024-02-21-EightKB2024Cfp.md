EightKB is back for 2024! Our call for speakers is open and you can find it here: -
[https://sessionize.com/eightkb-2024/](https://sessionize.com/eightkb-2024/)

Once again we're looking for intermediate to advanced sessions on anything related to SQL Server. As a speaker this is your chance to really go all out!

There's no topic too advanced, you can do as many or as little demos as you'd like, choose a session length from 45 to 75 mins, and we'll help you prepare every step of the way (if you'd like us to).

The event is happening on the 8th of August so there's plenty of time yet!


Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/eightkbconf) and subscribe to our [YouTube channel](https://eightkb.online/streaming) to get updates about EightKB!

We hope you can be part of another great event!

                <p>
                    <em>May 24th, 2023!</em>
                </p>
                <h2>Where is this event?</h2>
                <p>100% Online</p>
                <h2>How much does it cost?</h2>
                <p>This is a completely <em>FREE</em> event</p>
                <h2>What's the format?</h2>
                <p>5-7 sessions (any more and all our brains would melt) from 45 to 75 minutes each. Each session will also have breakout rooms for questions and conversations after the session is complete.</p>
                <h2>Will sessions be recorded?</h2>
                <p>YES! Sessions will all be recorded and available on YouTube after the event.</p>
                <h2>What level are the sessions?</h2>
                <p>The primary goal of this event is to deliver high value and highly technical content (we want your brain to melt, but you should be able to use some of this information after your brain re-forms). Below is the guide for session levels using DBCC PAGE as an example:</p>

                <b>500</b> - I wrote DBCC PAGE<br/>
                <b>8192</b> - struct page {<br/>
                }
                </p>
                <h2>Where does EightKB stand on diversity and inclusion?</h2>
                <p>Core to EightKB's goals as an event is to build a diverse and inclusive event and speaker schedule at each event. We want our attendees and speakers to be able to bring their whole selves to the event and have a sense of belonging amongst the group. The EightKB organizers promise to the community to build a schedule representing what we want the community to look like, not just those who can submit sessions. Part of creating a sustainable & welcoming community is investing in the next generation of content creators and public speakers. We will continually encourage and mentor speakers from underrepresented groups so that they can share their expert-level stories with our community.</p>
